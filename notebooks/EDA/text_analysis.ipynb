MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nResults of Operations\\n\\n- Marketing\\n\\nCrude oil marketing revenues, operating earnings and selected costs were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,875,885\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,050,497\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,863,057\\n\\nOperating earnings\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,895\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,854\\n\\n$\\n\\n40,369\\n\\nDepreciation\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,097\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,626\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,682\\n\\nDriver commissions\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,262\\n\\n$\\n\\n21,744\\n\\n$\\n\\n19,478\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,732\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,446\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,659\\n\\nFuel\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,928\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,851\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,808\\n\\nSupplemental volume and price information:\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nField Level Purchases per day (1)\\n\\nCrude Oil – barrels\\n\\n106,400\\n\\n117,100\\n\\n106,000\\n\\nAverage Purchase Price\\n\\nCrude Oil – per barrel\\n\\n$\\n\\n45.41\\n\\n$\\n\\n89.40\\n\\n$\\n\\n99.57\\n\\n___________________\\n\\n(1) Reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the field level of operations.\\n\\nBeginning in late 2011, crude oil purchase volumes and hence revenues started to increase following new production established by the Company's customer base, primarily in the Eagle Ford shale of South Texas.  This trend continued into late 2014 supported by a relatively high market price for crude oil in the $90 per barrel range.  Beginning in November 2014, crude oil prices began to decline significantly and the Company's average crude oil purchase price dropped to $54 per barrel by December 2014 from $90 per barrel in September 2014.  Declining prices continued into 2015 curtailing new drilling efforts.  The combination of reduced prices and volumes caused revenues to fall 54 percent in 2015 relative to 2014.\\n\\n-\\n\\nField Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP Measure)\\n\\nTwo significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations.  As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines.  Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent.  As a result, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation and valuation losses.  Over time, these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow.  While crude oil prices fluctuated from 2013 through 2015, the net impact yielded inventory valuation losses in each of the years presented.\\n\\n18\\n\\nCrude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates.  Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date.  The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level).  Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not subject to fair value treatment.  The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires recognition of ‟mark-to-market\" gains and losses.\\n\\nThe impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized in the following reconciliation from a GAAP to a non-GAAP measure (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAs reported segment operating earnings\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,895\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,854\\n\\n$\\n\\n40,369\\n\\nAdd (less) -\\n\\nInventory liquidation (gains) losses\\n\\n5,357\\n\\n14,247\\n\\n3,824\\n\\nDerivative valuation (gains) losses\\n\\n188\\n\\n(312\\n\\n)\\n\\n193\\n\\nField level operating earnings (1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n28,440\\n\\n$\\n\\n34,789\\n\\n$\\n\\n44,386\\n\\n____________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nSuch designation is unique to the Company and is not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants.  The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations.\\n\\nThe Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average composite price in barrels as follows:\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nBarrels\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nBarrels\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nCrude oil inventory\\n\\n261,718\\n\\n$\\n\\n29.31\\n\\n292,355\\n\\n$\\n\\n46.11\\n\\nField level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivering it to market sales points.  Comparative field level operating earnings decreased in 2015 relative to 2014 and in 2014 relative to 2013 as competition and additional industry infrastructure development progressed in the region.  The year 2015 also experienced volume declines and added margin pressure as crude oil prices continued to decline.    Previously, a key factor in unit margins was the value difference between crude oil supplies in the mid-continent region of the United States versus crude oil supply costs in the eastern region of the United States. The Company was able to capture some of this value difference by shipping crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast to points east. Due to competitive pressures during 2014, the opportunity for the Company to capture this location-based unit value difference evaporated which reduced earnings.  Further, depreciation charges increased as new equipment was added and driver commissions increased in 2014 and 2015 as a result of driver shortages in 2014 and longer hauls in 2015, necessitated by the competition to retain volumes.  An adverse claims experience increased insurance costs in 2015 but this experience cycle is not expected to recur in 2016.  Initially in 2015, operating earnings benefited from reduced fuel costs but this advantage has been largely lost as competitive pressures necessitated passing such savings back to suppliers in the form of higher purchase prices.\\n\\nHistorically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue.  See ‟Item 1A, Risk Factors – Fluctuations in oil and gas prices could have an adverse effect on the Company\".\\n\\n19\\n\\n- Transportation\\n\\nThe transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n63,331\\n\\n(8.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,968\\n\\n.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,783\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\nOperating earnings\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,701\\n\\n(22.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,750\\n\\n(8.3\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,180\\n\\n(49\\n\\n)%\\n\\nDepreciation\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,554\\n\\n1.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,416\\n\\n4.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,099\\n\\n20\\n\\n%\\n\\nDriver commissions\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,265\\n\\n(1.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,428\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,152\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,543\\n\\n(18.5\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,574\\n\\n(6.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,937\\n\\n20\\n\\n%\\n\\nDiesel fuel\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,134\\n\\n(39.7\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,487\\n\\n(9.0\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,813\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\nMaintenance Expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,365\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,143\\n\\n12.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,464\\n\\n24.6\\n\\n%\\n\\nMileage\\n\\n25,205\\n\\n(4.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n26,314\\n\\n(3.4\\n\\n)%\\n\\n27,243\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n______________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRepresents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\\n\\nThe Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time.  To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nTotal transportation revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n63,331\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,968\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,783\\n\\nDiesel fuel cost\\n\\n(8,134\\n\\n)\\n\\n(13,487\\n\\n)\\n\\n(14,813\\n\\n)\\n\\nRevenues net of fuel\\n\\n$\\n\\n55,197\\n\\n$\\n\\n55,481\\n\\n$\\n\\n53,970\\n\\nRevenues net of fuel costs appear relatively flat while reported mileage as shown above has been decreasing from 2013 to 2015.  This apparent paradox results because of rate increases necessitated by higher driver and equipment costs in the more recent years.\\n\\nThe operating earnings trend line has declined since 2013.  This is caused by two primary factors.  First and most recently, mileage is reduced reflecting a drop off in demand originating in the third quarter of 2015.   Second, maintenance expense and depreciation following new equipment additions has steadily increased.  Partially offsetting these higher costs is reduced insurance expense for 2015 resulting from favorable claims experience.  The net result is still an adverse impact on operating earnings and management is working to reverse this situation.  The demand problem is being addressed with increased marketing efforts.  The cost problem is being addressed through sales of older inefficient equipment, a revamp of the approach to equipment maintenance and certain personnel layoffs that occurred in January 2016.\\n\\n20\\n\\nEquipment additions and retirement for the transportation fleet were as follows:\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nNew truck-tractors purchased\\n\\n60 units\\n\\n40 units\\n\\n-\\n\\nTruck-tractors retired\\n\\n-\\n\\n40 units\\n\\n-\\n\\nNew trailers purchased\\n\\n12 units\\n\\n30 units\\n\\n35 units\\n\\nTrailers retired\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n17 units\\n\\nThe sale of retired equipment produced gains of $16,000 and $432,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company's predominate customers are the domestic petrochemical industry.  Contributing to customer demand is low natural gas prices (a basic feedstock cost for the petrochemical industry) and high export demand for petrochemicals.  Lower natural gas prices beginning in 2011 stimulated and provided an opportunity for increased profitability and this was evident in 2011 and 2012 results.  However, increased operating expenses and an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers affected the Company by suppressing revenues and results of operations during the heavy demand cycle of 2014 and early 2015.  More recently, the United States economy appears to have weakened with demand slackening.  In addition, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency may weaken demand for U.S. sourced petrochemical products.  As transportation revenues increase or decrease, operating earnings will typically increase or decrease at an accelerated rate.  This occurs because the fixed cost components of the Company's operation do not vary with changing revenues.  As currently configured, operating earnings achieve break-even levels when annual revenues average approximately $60 million.  Above that level, operating earnings will grow and below that level, losses result.\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and Gas\\n\\nOil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices.  Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and selected expenses were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,063\\n\\n(62.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,361\\n\\n(5.4\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,129\\n\\n(11\\n\\n)%\\n\\nOperating earnings (loss) (2)\\n\\n(19,016\\n\\n)\\n\\n153.2\\n\\n%\\n\\n(7,510\\n\\n)\\n\\n255.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n(2,113\\n\\n)\\n\\n42\\n\\n%\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion\\n\\n5,066\\n\\n(33.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n7,573\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n7,494\\n\\n(15\\n\\n)%\\n\\nDry hole expense\\n\\n817\\n\\n(21.0\\n\\n)%\\n\\n1,034\\n\\n343.8\\n\\n%\\n\\n233\\n\\n441.9\\n\\n%\\n\\nProspect impairments\\n\\n1,758\\n\\n(56.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n4,008\\n\\n218.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,257\\n\\n46.8\\n\\n%\\n\\nProducing property impairments\\n\\n10,324\\n\\n158.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n4,001\\n\\n191.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,373\\n\\n(71\\n\\n)%\\n\\n______________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRepresents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIncludes gains from property sales of $2.5 million in 2014.\\n\\n21\\n\\nAs shown in the table below, declining crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices coupled with declining volumes acted to reduce revenues and earnings for the comparative years presented.  The sales volume decrease followed normal production declines as persistently low prices curtailed the development of natural gas properties in 2013 and 2014 and curtailed crude oil properties in 2015.  Contributing to operating losses were property impairments as shown above.  Property impairments resulted in 2015 and 2014 following fourth quarter declines in crude oil prices while impairments in 2013 followed adverse drilling results.\\n\\nComparative volumes and prices were as follows:\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nProduction Volumes\\n\\n- Crude oil\\n\\n50,000\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n79,100\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n84,400\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n- Natural gas\\n\\n889,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n1,133,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n1,608,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n- Natural gas liquids\\n\\n42,100\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n45,900\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n24,400\\n\\nBbls\\n\\nAverage Price\\n\\n- Crude oil\\n\\n$\\n\\n46.51\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n$\\n\\n88.42\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n$\\n\\n88.70\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n- Natural gas\\n\\n$\\n\\n2.46\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n$\\n\\n4.65\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n$\\n\\n3.75\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n- Natural gas liquids\\n\\n$\\n\\n12.70\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n$\\n\\n28.83\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n$\\n\\n25.06\\n\\nBbl\\n\\nDuring 2015, the Company participated in the drilling of 14 wells with one dry hole.  No wells were in process as of December 31, 2015 and no drilling is currently planned for 2016.\\n\\nAn independent evaluation of estimated oil and gas reserves and the estimated future income derived therefrom is prepared on an annual basis.  See also Note (11) to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following estimates of future net income from oil and gas properties before income taxes based on average prices during 2015 is presented in such report as of December 31, 2015 as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\n\\nFuture net income before taxes\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2016\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,575\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2017\\n\\n992\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2018\\n\\n940\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2019\\n\\n816\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2020\\n\\n680\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\n3,410\\n\\nTotal future net income before taxes\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,413\\n\\nNet capitalized oil and gas property costs (remaining net book value) associated with the projected future net income stream as of December 31, 2015 was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\n\\nNet capitalized cost of oil and gas properties\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,001\\n\\nCapitalized oil and gas property costs are amortized against income as the underlying oil and gas reserves are produced (units-of-production method). Therefore as illustrated above, absent price increases, it is unlikely that the Company will report operating income from its oil and gas segment for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n22\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and gas property sales\\n\\nDuring 2014, the Company sold its interest in certain Oklahoma and Texas properties for proceeds totaling $2,553,000 and half of its interest in certain South Texas (Lavaca County) properties for proceeds totaling $1,509,000.  Combined, the Company recorded a $2,528,000 pre-tax gain from these transactions.  The Company retained an interest in the South Texas properties as development of such project continues, although the Company chose to reduce its level of risk associated with the development. The other Texas and Oklahoma properties were sold because they were nearing the end of their economic life.\\n\\n-\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expense, interest income and income tax\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses were elevated in 2015 due to a $1.1 million lump sum payment made during the first quarter of 2015 to the Company's former President upon retirement and termination of his previous employment agreement.  The provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods.\\n\\n-\\n\\nDiscontinued operations\\n\\nDuring 2012, the Company sold certain assets associated with its then petroleum refined products marketing business and discontinued that operation.  In 2014, the Company sold the warehouse and real estate used by the former operation for $664,000 in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $533,000, with such gain reported in discontinued operations for 2014.  In 2013, the Company completed an orderly wind-down and closure of its natural gas marketing business due to inadequate earnings.  The Company incurred employee severance and other shut-down costs totaling $416,000 as a result of this event.  All obligations were satisfied and no further matters are anticipated.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nThe Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is dependent on the success of future operations.  See discussion under ‟Item 1A. Risk Factors\".  The most significant source of liquidity, over time, is the cash yield from annual net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments.  The Company has no debt and funds all of its capital projects from this annual stream of cash.  In most annual periods, the cash inflow from this source exceeds capital spending outflows.  Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly.\\n\\nCash provided from operating activities was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n\\n$\\n\\n25,477\\n\\n$\\n\\n47,133\\n\\n$\\n\\n43,976\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations.  Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts   and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nCash\\n\\n$\\n\\n91,877\\n\\n$\\n\\n80,184\\n\\nWorking capital\\n\\n$\\n\\n96,340\\n\\n$\\n\\n82,342\\n\\nThe Company relies on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation.  In this regard, the Company generally maintains substantial cash balances and avoids debt obligations.  Cash balances were increased during 2015 due to cash generated from operations given that depreciation, depletion and impairments are a non-cash expense.\\n\\n23\\n\\nAt various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations.  Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company.  In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also ‟early pay\" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production.  Such ‟early payments\" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date.  The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company.  Early payments and cash collateral received from customer's increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date.\\n\\nThe Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60 million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil.  Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled when the underlying purchase obligation is satisfied through cash payment when due.  The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply.\\n\\nEarly payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nEarly payments received\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,770\\n\\n$\\n\\n57,404\\n\\nCash collateral received\\n\\n$\\n\\n840\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,594\\n\\nPrepayments to suppliers\\n\\n$\\n\\n167\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,872\\n\\nEarly payments to suppliers\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,645\\n\\n$\\n\\n35,500\\n\\nLetters of credit outstanding\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,300\\n\\nThe necessity for early payments, collateral posting and letters of credit is substantially reduced as of December 31, 2015, consistent with lower crude commodity prices.\\n\\nManagement believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\\n\\nQuarterly dividends of $.22 per common share or $928,000 were paid during each quarter of 2015 and 2014 and during both the third and fourth quarters of 2013.\\n\\n-\\n\\nCapital projects\\n\\nThe Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses, which comprise substantially all of the Company's investing cash outflows for each of the periods in this filing.  The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs.  Except for commitments totaling $12,393,000 associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract.\\n\\n24\\n\\nA five year history of capital projects and planned 2016 spending is as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nPlanned\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\nCrude oil marketing\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,554\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,391\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,343\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,598\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,126\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\nTruck transportation\\n\\n14,118\\n\\n15,538\\n\\n3,165\\n\\n8,994\\n\\n6,579\\n\\n5,500\\n\\nOil and gas exploration\\n\\n24,580\\n\\n23,083\\n\\n13,094\\n\\n7,931\\n\\n2,369\\n\\n-\\n\\nMedical management\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n$\\n\\n52,252\\n\\n$\\n\\n51,012\\n\\n$\\n\\n27,602\\n\\n$\\n\\n30,523\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,074\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,500\\n\\nMarketing segment spending levels were consistent for 2011 through 2014 backed by crude oil prices remaining strong, in the $90 - $100 per barrel range.  In late 2014, crude prices fell and spending was curtailed into 2015 and prospective 2016.\\n\\nFor transportation, the 2011 and 2012 period saw stepped up equipment replacements as customer demand increased following a cut back in such activity following the 2008 national recession.  The year 2013 was stable then expenditures ramped up in 2014 to add capacity tracking with the petrochemical industry expansion efforts stimulated by abundant low prices of natural gas.  In late 2015 however, demand for truck services weakened and only previously planned expenditures will occur in 2016 for this segment.  The major project for 2016 is improvements to the existing Houston terminal facility.\\n\\nOil and gas exploration capital spending was initially stimulated just prior to 2011 when natural gas prices exceeded $5 per mmbtu.  Capital spending in 2011 and 2012 was focused on natural gas development, but falling prices stopped such development in 2013.  In 2013 and 2014, exploration spending was active due to high crude prices as development concentrated on crude oil properties.  When crude oil prices dropped in 2015, all such activity was no longer economical.\\n\\nMedical management is a January 2016 initiative where the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Ben Cap LLC (Bencap) for $2,200,000.  This investment evolved from the Company's efforts to manage employee medical insurance costs.  Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.  Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap's methodology audits and pays claims based on a multiplier which takes into consideration a premium over Medicare rates and/or a premium over the ‟Cost-to-Charge Ratio\" which medical facility providers must file with the Federal government.  The Company has utilized the Bencap methodology over the past three years to process and pay medical claims for its employees, including all management personnel.  The Company believes the Bencap approach provides self-insured employers the opportunity for substantial savings over conventional medical insurance without sacrificing the level of employee benefits.  In fact, employee benefits may improve since the individual employee is no longer locked into a narrow list of providers.  Bencap will primarily use this funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete in the medical benefits marketplace.\\n\\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Cash Obligations\\n\\nThe Company maintains certain lease arrangements with independent truck owner-operators for use of their equipment and driver services on a month-to-month basis.  In addition, the Company enters into office space and certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for its crude oil marketing business.  Such storage and access contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts.   All lease commitments qualify for off-balance sheet treatment.  The Company has no capital lease obligations.  Rental expense was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n25\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nRental expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,168\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,755\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,281\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, rental obligations under long-term non-cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,218\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,160\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,697\\n\\n$\\n\\n318\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,393\\n\\nIn addition to its lease obligations, the Company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil in connection with its marketing activities.  Such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales, which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations.  Approximate commodity purchase obligations as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nJanuary\\n\\nRemaining\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,830\\n\\n$\\n\\n130\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,960\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nFrom time to time, the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases. In the past, during such cyclical periods, the Company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable.  The Company's primary insurance needs are workers' compensation, automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for its employees.  Insurance costs are as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nInsurance costs\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,570\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,800\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,900\\n\\nInsurance rates may experience increases during 2016 subject to market conditions and claims experience.  Because the Company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases, any increase must be absorbed by existing operations.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nIn all phases of its operations, the Company encounters strong competition from a number of entities. Many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the Company. The Company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit, pricing of available materials and quality of service, as well as for the acquisition of mineral properties. The Company's marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities.  These major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the Company.  From time to time in recent years, there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace.  This in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas. As a result, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization.\\n\\n26\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nPersistently low crude oil prices, coupled with declining oil production, are expected to adversely impact the Company's crude oil marketing operation.  The goal is to maintain at least 85 percent of 2015 supply volumes, but such effort may come at the expense of reduced unit margins.    Demand for transportation services remains uncertain.  The focus in transportation, therefore, is on both aggressive marketing and cost containment.  For the oil and gas segment, the effort is to reduce cost and optimize cash flow as reserves are produced.  In January 2016, the Company invested in an employer-oriented medical management services firm and development of this investment area continues.\\n\\nThe Company has the following major objectives for 2016:\\n\\n-\\n\\nMarketing—manage declining supply volumes and unit margins to maintain operating earnings at the $15 million level, exclusive of inventory valuation changes.\\n\\n-\\n\\nTransportation—increase truck utilization and improve cost efficiencies to maintain operating earnings at the $3 million level.\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and gas—curtail all exploration activity; maintain oil and gas production; reduce operating overhead.\\n\\n-\\n\\nEmployer-oriented medical management services—develop earnings enhancement opportunities arising from employer and employee insurance coverage.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\\n\\nFair Value Accounting\\n\\nThe Company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting.  The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during 2015, 2014 and 2013.\\n\\nThe Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts.  On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts that typically have durations of less than 18 months.  As of December 31, 2015, all of the Company's market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs) or from inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs). See discussion under ‟Fair Value Measurements\" in Note (1) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe Company's fair value contracts give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment.  The Company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the Company's risk management policies.  Such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management's objectives, strategies and current market conditions.\\n\\nTrade Accounts\\n\\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the Company.  Particularly within the Company's energy marketing, oil and gas exploration, and production operations, there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties (including transaction counterparties) to provide adequate information for the proper recording of accounts receivable or payable. Substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the Company with the source documents for recording trade activity.  It is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents. This typically requires the Company to absorb, benefit from, or pass along such corrections to another third party.\\n\\n27\\n\\nDue to the volume and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties, this is a difficult area to control and manage.  The Company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties.  Ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the Company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances.  The Company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims.  In addition, the Company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance.  Nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry.\\n\\nOil and Gas Reserve Estimate\\n\\nThe value of the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  Reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors.  The accuracy of these estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data, production performance data, reservoir engineering data, the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data.  The process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision (usually on an annual basis) as additional information becomes available. Calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production, and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates. Also, certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing.  The Company's calculations assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer's estimates, except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts.  There can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions, governmental regulation, political conditions, economic conditions, weather conditions, market uncertainty, and other factors, impact the market price for oil and natural gas.\\n\\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting, so only costs (including development dry hole costs) associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized.  Estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the Company's units of production method for depreciating, depleting and amortizing oil and natural gas properties. Estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the Company's periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment.\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\nAREC is named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana based lawsuits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.  Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging oil and gas production subsidence contributing to the formation of a sink hole.  AREC is currently named as a defendant in three such suits.    While management does not believe that a material adverse effect will result from the claims, significant attorney fees will be incurred to defend these items.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal and/or settlement costs for these matters.\\n\\nFrom time to time as incident to its operations, the Company becomes involved in various accidents, lawsuits and/or disputes.  Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry.  In addition, the Company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws, environmental laws and labor laws, among others.  Should an incident occur, management evaluates the claim based on its nature, the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage.  To the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the Company, management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines.\\n\\n28\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nThe Company's crude oil marketing customers are invoiced monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms.  Revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer.  Where required, the Company also recognizes fair value or mark-to-market gains and losses related to its commodity activities. See discussion under ‟Revenue Recognition\" in Note (1) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nTransportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided.  Oil and natural gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.  The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the transition alternatives.\\n\\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nIn July 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for inventory to provide for the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or ‟ net realizable value,\" as defined in the standard.  The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in the statement of financial position.  The amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the balance sheet.  The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective December 31, 2015.\\n\\nManagement believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption.</td>\n",

This trend continued into late 2014 supported by a relatively high market price for crude oil in the $90 per barrel range.  Beginning in November 2014, crude oil prices began to decline significantly and the Company's average crude oil purchase price dropped to $54 per barrel by December 2014 from $90 per barrel in September 2014.  Declining prices continued into 2015 curtailing new drilling efforts.  The combination of reduced prices and volumes caused revenues to fall 54 percent in 2015 relative to 2014.\\n\\n-\\n\\nField Level Operating Earnings (Non GAAP Measure)\\n\\nTwo significant factors affecting comparative crude oil segment operating earnings are inventory valuations and forward commodity contract (derivatives or mark-to-market) valuations.  As a purchaser and shipper of crude oil, the Company holds inventory in storage tanks and third-party pipelines.  Inventory sales turnover occurs approximately every three days, but the quantity held in stock at the end of a given period is reasonably consistent.  As a result, during periods of increasing crude oil prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation gains while during periods of falling prices, the Company recognizes inventory liquidation and valuation losses.  Over time, these gains and losses tend to offset and have limited impact on cash flow.  While crude oil prices fluctuated from 2013 through 2015, the net impact yielded inventory valuation losses in each of the years presented.\\n\\n18\\n\\nCrude oil marketing operating earnings are also affected by the valuations of the Company's forward month commodity contracts (derivative instruments) as of the various report dates.  Such non-cash valuations are calculated and recorded at each period end based on the underlying data existing as of such date.  The Company generally enters into these derivative contracts as part of a pricing strategy based on crude oil purchases at the wellhead (field level).  Only those contracts qualifying as derivative instruments are accorded fair value treatment while the companion contracts to purchase crude oil at the wellhead (field level) are not subject to fair value treatment.  The valuation of derivative instruments at period end requires recognition of ‟mark-to-market\" gains and losses.\\n\\nThe impact on crude oil segment operating earnings of inventory liquidations and derivative valuations is summarized in the following reconciliation from a GAAP to a non-GAAP measure (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAs reported segment operating earnings\\n\\n$\\n\\n22,895\\n\\n$\\n\\n20,854\\n\\n$\\n\\n40,369\\n\\nAdd (less) -\\n\\nInventory liquidation (gains) losses\\n\\n5,357\\n\\n14,247\\n\\n3,824\\n\\nDerivative valuation (gains) losses\\n\\n188\\n\\n(312\\n\\n)\\n\\n193\\n\\nField level operating earnings (1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n28,440\\n\\n$\\n\\n34,789\\n\\n$\\n\\n44,386\\n\\n____________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nSuch designation is unique to the Company and is not comparable to any similar measures developed by industry participants.  The Company utilizes such data to evaluate the profitability of its operations.\\n\\nThe Company held crude oil inventory at a weighted average composite price in barrels as follows:\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nBarrels\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nBarrels\\n\\nPrice\\n\\nCrude oil inventory\\n\\n261,718\\n\\n$\\n\\n29.31\\n\\n292,355\\n\\n$\\n\\n46.11\\n\\nField level operating earnings and field level purchase volumes (see earlier table) depict the Company's day-to-day operation of acquiring crude oil at the wellhead, transporting the material, and delivering it to market sales points.  Comparative field level operating earnings decreased in 2015 relative to 2014 and in 2014 relative to 2013 as competition and additional industry infrastructure development progressed in the region.  The year 2015 also experienced volume declines and added margin pressure as crude oil prices continued to decline.    Previously, a key factor in unit margins was the value difference between crude oil supplies in the mid-continent region of the United States versus crude oil supply costs in the eastern region of the United States. The Company was able to capture some of this value difference by shipping crude oil from the Texas Gulf Coast to points east. Due to competitive pressures during 2014, the opportunity for the Company to capture this location-based unit value difference evaporated which reduced earnings.  Further, depreciation charges increased as new equipment was added and driver commissions increased in 2014 and 2015 as a result of driver shortages in 2014 and longer hauls in 2015, necessitated by the competition to retain volumes.  An adverse claims experience increased insurance costs in 2015 but this experience cycle is not expected to recur in 2016.  Initially in 2015, operating earnings benefited from reduced fuel costs but this advantage has been largely lost as competitive pressures necessitated passing such savings back to suppliers in the form of higher purchase prices.\\n\\nHistorically, prices received for crude oil have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue.  See ‟Item 1A, Risk Factors – Fluctuations in oil and gas prices could have an adverse effect on the Company\".\\n\\n19\\n\\n- Transportation\\n\\nThe transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n63,331\\n\\n(8.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,968\\n\\n.3\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,783\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\nOperating earnings\\n\\n$\\n\\n3,701\\n\\n(22.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,750\\n\\n(8.3\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,180\\n\\n(49\\n\\n)%\\n\\nDepreciation\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,554\\n\\n1.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,416\\n\\n4.5\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,099\\n\\n20\\n\\n%\\n\\nDriver commissions\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,265\\n\\n(1.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,428\\n\\n2.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,152\\n\\n3\\n\\n%\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,543\\n\\n(18.5\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,574\\n\\n(6.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,937\\n\\n20\\n\\n%\\n\\nDiesel fuel\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,134\\n\\n(39.7\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,487\\n\\n(9.0\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,813\\n\\n2\\n\\n%\\n\\nMaintenance Expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,365\\n\\n3.6\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,143\\n\\n12.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,464\\n\\n24.6\\n\\n%\\n\\nMileage\\n\\n25,205\\n\\n(4.2\\n\\n)%\\n\\n26,314\\n\\n(3.4\\n\\n)%\\n\\n27,243\\n\\n3.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n______________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRepresents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\\n\\nThe Company's revenue rate structure includes a component for fuel costs such that fuel cost fluctuations are largely passed through to the customer over time.  To illustrate, a calculation of revenues net of fuel cost is presented below (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nTotal transportation revenue\\n\\n$\\n\\n63,331\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,968\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,783\\n\\nDiesel fuel cost\\n\\n(8,134\\n\\n)\\n\\n(13,487\\n\\n)\\n\\n(14,813\\n\\n)\\n\\nRevenues net of fuel\\n\\n$\\n\\n55,197\\n\\n$\\n\\n55,481\\n\\n$\\n\\n53,970\\n\\nRevenues net of fuel costs appear relatively flat while reported mileage as shown above has been decreasing from 2013 to 2015.  This apparent paradox results because of rate increases necessitated by higher driver and equipment costs in the more recent years.\\n\\nThe operating earnings trend line has declined since 2013.  This is caused by two primary factors.  First and most recently, mileage is reduced reflecting a drop off in demand originating in the third quarter of 2015.   Second, maintenance expense and depreciation following new equipment additions has steadily increased.  Partially offsetting these higher costs is reduced insurance expense for 2015 resulting from favorable claims experience.  The net result is still an adverse impact on operating earnings and management is working to reverse this situation.  The demand problem is being addressed with increased marketing efforts.  The cost problem is being addressed through sales of older inefficient equipment, a revamp of the approach to equipment maintenance and certain personnel layoffs that occurred in January 2016.\\n\\n20\\n\\nEquipment additions and retirement for the transportation fleet were as follows:\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nNew truck-tractors purchased\\n\\n60 units\\n\\n40 units\\n\\n-\\n\\nTruck-tractors retired\\n\\n-\\n\\n40 units\\n\\n-\\n\\nNew trailers purchased\\n\\n12 units\\n\\n30 units\\n\\n35 units\\n\\nTrailers retired\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n17 units\\n\\nThe sale of retired equipment produced gains of $16,000 and $432,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\\n\\nThe Company's predominate customers are the domestic petrochemical industry.  Contributing to customer demand is low natural gas prices (a basic feedstock cost for the petrochemical industry) and high export demand for petrochemicals.  Lower natural gas prices beginning in 2011 stimulated and provided an opportunity for increased profitability and this was evident in 2011 and 2012 results.  However, increased operating expenses and an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers affected the Company by suppressing revenues and results of operations during the heavy demand cycle of 2014 and early 2015.  More recently, the United States economy appears to have weakened with demand slackening.  In addition, the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currency may weaken demand for U.S. sourced petrochemical products.  As transportation revenues increase or decrease, operating earnings will typically increase or decrease at an accelerated rate.  This occurs because the fixed cost components of the Company's operation do not vary with changing revenues.  As currently configured, operating earnings achieve break-even levels when annual revenues average approximately $60 million.  Above that level, operating earnings will grow and below that level, losses result.\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and Gas\\n\\nOil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily a function of crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices.  Comparative amounts for revenues, operating earnings and selected expenses were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nAmount\\n\\nChange (1)\\n\\nRevenues\\n\\n$\\n\\n5,063\\n\\n(62.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,361\\n\\n(5.4\\n\\n)%\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,129\\n\\n(11\\n\\n)%\\n\\nOperating earnings (loss) (2)\\n\\n(19,016\\n\\n)\\n\\n153.2\\n\\n%\\n\\n(7,510\\n\\n)\\n\\n255.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n(2,113\\n\\n)\\n\\n42\\n\\n%\\n\\nDepreciation and depletion\\n\\n5,066\\n\\n(33.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n7,573\\n\\n1.1\\n\\n%\\n\\n7,494\\n\\n(15\\n\\n)%\\n\\nDry hole expense\\n\\n817\\n\\n(21.0\\n\\n)%\\n\\n1,034\\n\\n343.8\\n\\n%\\n\\n233\\n\\n441.9\\n\\n%\\n\\nProspect impairments\\n\\n1,758\\n\\n(56.1\\n\\n)%\\n\\n4,008\\n\\n218.9\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,257\\n\\n46.8\\n\\n%\\n\\nProducing property impairments\\n\\n10,324\\n\\n158.0\\n\\n%\\n\\n4,001\\n\\n191.4\\n\\n%\\n\\n1,373\\n\\n(71\\n\\n)%\\n\\n______________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRepresents the percentage increase (decrease) from the prior year.\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nIncludes gains from property sales of $2.5 million in 2014.\\n\\n21\\n\\nAs shown in the table below, declining crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid prices coupled with declining volumes acted to reduce revenues and earnings for the comparative years presented.  The sales volume decrease followed normal production declines as persistently low prices curtailed the development of natural gas properties in 2013 and 2014 and curtailed crude oil properties in 2015.  Contributing to operating losses were property impairments as shown above.  Property impairments resulted in 2015 and 2014 following fourth quarter declines in crude oil prices while impairments in 2013 followed adverse drilling results.\\n\\nComparative volumes and prices were as follows:\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nProduction Volumes\\n\\n- Crude oil\\n\\n50,000\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n79,100\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n84,400\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n- Natural gas\\n\\n889,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n1,133,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n1,608,000\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n- Natural gas liquids\\n\\n42,100\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n45,900\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n24,400\\n\\nBbls\\n\\nAverage Price\\n\\n- Crude oil\\n\\n$\\n\\n46.51\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n$\\n\\n88.42\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n$\\n\\n88.70\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n- Natural gas\\n\\n$\\n\\n2.46\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n$\\n\\n4.65\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n$\\n\\n3.75\\n\\nMcf\\n\\n- Natural gas liquids\\n\\n$\\n\\n12.70\\n\\nBbls\\n\\n$\\n\\n28.83\\n\\nBbl\\n\\n$\\n\\n25.06\\n\\nBbl\\n\\nDuring 2015, the Company participated in the drilling of 14 wells with one dry hole.  No wells were in process as of December 31, 2015 and no drilling is currently planned for 2016.\\n\\nAn independent evaluation of estimated oil and gas reserves and the estimated future income derived therefrom is prepared on an annual basis.  See also Note (11) to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following estimates of future net income from oil and gas properties before income taxes based on average prices during 2015 is presented in such report as of December 31, 2015 as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\n\\nFuture net income before taxes\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2016\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,575\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2017\\n\\n992\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2018\\n\\n940\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2019\\n\\n816\\n\\n- Estimate for the year 2020\\n\\n680\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\n3,410\\n\\nTotal future net income before taxes\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,413\\n\\nNet capitalized oil and gas property costs (remaining net book value) associated with the projected future net income stream as of December 31, 2015 was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of\\n\\nDecember 31, 2015\\n\\nNet capitalized cost of oil and gas properties\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,001\\n\\nCapitalized oil and gas property costs are amortized against income as the underlying oil and gas reserves are produced (units-of-production method). Therefore as illustrated above, absent price increases, it is unlikely that the Company will report operating income from its oil and gas segment for the foreseeable future.\\n\\n22\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and gas property sales\\n\\nDuring 2014, the Company sold its interest in certain Oklahoma and Texas properties for proceeds totaling $2,553,000 and half of its interest in certain South Texas (Lavaca County) properties for proceeds totaling $1,509,000.  Combined, the Company recorded a $2,528,000 pre-tax gain from these transactions.  The Company retained an interest in the South Texas properties as development of such project continues, although the Company chose to reduce its level of risk associated with the development. The other Texas and Oklahoma properties were sold because they were nearing the end of their economic life.\\n\\n-\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expense, interest income and income tax\\n\\nGeneral and administrative expenses were elevated in 2015 due to a $1.1 million lump sum payment made during the first quarter of 2015 to the Company's former President upon retirement and termination of his previous employment agreement.  The provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods.\\n\\n-\\n\\nDiscontinued operations\\n\\nDuring 2012, the Company sold certain assets associated with its then petroleum refined products marketing business and discontinued that operation.  In 2014, the Company sold the warehouse and real estate used by the former operation for $664,000 in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $533,000, with such gain reported in discontinued operations for 2014.  In 2013, the Company completed an orderly wind-down and closure of its natural gas marketing business due to inadequate earnings.  The Company incurred employee severance and other shut-down costs totaling $416,000 as a result of this event.  All obligations were satisfied and no further matters are anticipated.\\n\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nThe Company's liquidity derives from net cash provided by operating activities and is dependent on the success of future operations.  See discussion under ‟Item 1A. Risk Factors\".  The most significant source of liquidity, over time, is the cash yield from annual net earnings factoring in the non-cash book expense items for depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairments.  The Company has no debt and funds all of its capital projects from this annual stream of cash.  In most annual periods, the cash inflow from this source exceeds capital spending outflows.  Should cash inflow subside or turn negative, the Company will curtail its capital spending accordingly.\\n\\nCash provided from operating activities was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities\\n\\n$\\n\\n25,477\\n\\n$\\n\\n47,133\\n\\n$\\n\\n43,976\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations.  Cash balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day-to-day cash needs and such amounts   and working capital, the excess of current assets over current liabilities, were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nCash\\n\\n$\\n\\n91,877\\n\\n$\\n\\n80,184\\n\\nWorking capital\\n\\n$\\n\\n96,340\\n\\n$\\n\\n82,342\\n\\nThe Company relies on its ability to obtain open-line trade credit from its suppliers especially with respect to its crude oil marketing operation.  In this regard, the Company generally maintains substantial cash balances and avoids debt obligations.  Cash balances were increased during 2015 due to cash generated from operations given that depreciation, depletion and impairments are a non-cash expense.\\n\\n23\\n\\nAt various times each month, the Company makes cash prepayments and/or early payments in advance of the normal due date to certain suppliers of crude oil within the marketing operations.  Crude oil supply prepayments are recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the Company.  In addition, in order to secure crude oil supply, the Company may also ‟early pay\" its suppliers in advance of the normal payment due date of the twentieth of the month following the month of production.  Such ‟early payments\" reduce cash and accounts payable as of the balance sheet date.  The Company also requires certain customers to make similar early payments or to post cash collateral with the Company in order to support their purchases from the Company.  Early payments and cash collateral received from customer's increases cash and reduces accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date.\\n\\nThe Company maintains a stand-by letter of credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank to provide for the issuance of up to $60 million in stand-by letters of credit for the benefit of suppliers of crude oil.  Stand-by letters of credit are issued as needed and are cancelled when the underlying purchase obligation is satisfied through cash payment when due.  The issuance of stand-by letters of credit enables the Company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil supply.\\n\\nEarly payments, collateral and letters of credit amounts were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nAs of December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\nEarly payments received\\n\\n$\\n\\n16,770\\n\\n$\\n\\n57,404\\n\\nCash collateral received\\n\\n$\\n\\n840\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,594\\n\\nPrepayments to suppliers\\n\\n$\\n\\n167\\n\\n$\\n\\n7,872\\n\\nEarly payments to suppliers\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,645\\n\\n$\\n\\n35,500\\n\\nLetters of credit outstanding\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,000\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,300\\n\\nThe necessity for early payments, collateral posting and letters of credit is substantially reduced as of December 31, 2015, consistent with lower crude commodity prices.\\n\\nManagement believes current cash balances, together with expected cash generated from future operations, and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements (should the need arise) will be sufficient to meet short-term and long-term liquidity needs.\\n\\nQuarterly dividends of $.22 per common share or $928,000 were paid during each quarter of 2015 and 2014 and during both the third and fourth quarters of 2013.\\n\\n-\\n\\nCapital projects\\n\\nThe Company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its marketing, transportation and exploration businesses, which comprise substantially all of the Company's investing cash outflows for each of the periods in this filing.  The Company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs.  Except for commitments totaling $12,393,000 associated with barge affreightment contracts, storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space, the Company's future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract.\\n\\n24\\n\\nA five year history of capital projects and planned 2016 spending is as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nPlanned\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\nCrude oil marketing\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,554\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,391\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,343\\n\\n$\\n\\n13,598\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,126\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\nTruck transportation\\n\\n14,118\\n\\n15,538\\n\\n3,165\\n\\n8,994\\n\\n6,579\\n\\n5,500\\n\\nOil and gas exploration\\n\\n24,580\\n\\n23,083\\n\\n13,094\\n\\n7,931\\n\\n2,369\\n\\n-\\n\\nMedical management\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n$\\n\\n52,252\\n\\n$\\n\\n51,012\\n\\n$\\n\\n27,602\\n\\n$\\n\\n30,523\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,074\\n\\n$\\n\\n10,500\\n\\nMarketing segment spending levels were consistent for 2011 through 2014 backed by crude oil prices remaining strong, in the $90 - $100 per barrel range.  In late 2014, crude prices fell and spending was curtailed into 2015 and prospective 2016.\\n\\nFor transportation, the 2011 and 2012 period saw stepped up equipment replacements as customer demand increased following a cut back in such activity following the 2008 national recession.  The year 2013 was stable then expenditures ramped up in 2014 to add capacity tracking with the petrochemical industry expansion efforts stimulated by abundant low prices of natural gas.  In late 2015 however, demand for truck services weakened and only previously planned expenditures will occur in 2016 for this segment.  The major project for 2016 is improvements to the existing Houston terminal facility.\\n\\nOil and gas exploration capital spending was initially stimulated just prior to 2011 when natural gas prices exceeded $5 per mmbtu.  Capital spending in 2011 and 2012 was focused on natural gas development, but falling prices stopped such development in 2013.  In 2013 and 2014, exploration spending was active due to high crude prices as development concentrated on crude oil properties.  When crude oil prices dropped in 2015, all such activity was no longer economical.\\n\\nMedical management is a January 2016 initiative where the Company acquired a 30% member interest in Ben Cap LLC (Bencap) for $2,200,000.  This investment evolved from the Company's efforts to manage employee medical insurance costs.  Bencap provides medical insurance brokerage and medical claims auditing services to employers utilizing ERISA governed employee benefit plans.  Unlike the traditional approach to employee medical insurance, Bencap's methodology audits and pays claims based on a multiplier which takes into consideration a premium over Medicare rates and/or a premium over the ‟Cost-to-Charge Ratio\" which medical facility providers must file with the Federal government.  The Company has utilized the Bencap methodology over the past three years to process and pay medical claims for its employees, including all management personnel.  The Company believes the Bencap approach provides self-insured employers the opportunity for substantial savings over conventional medical insurance without sacrificing the level of employee benefits.  In fact, employee benefits may improve since the individual employee is no longer locked into a narrow list of providers.  Bencap will primarily use this funding to expand its back-office and sales support functions as it seeks to compete in the medical benefits marketplace.\\n\\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Cash Obligations\\n\\nThe Company maintains certain lease arrangements with independent truck owner-operators for use of their equipment and driver services on a month-to-month basis.  In addition, the Company enters into office space and certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for its crude oil marketing business.  Such storage and access contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts.   All lease commitments qualify for off-balance sheet treatment.  The Company has no capital lease obligations.  Rental expense was as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n25\\n\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nRental expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n11,168\\n\\n$\\n\\n9,755\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,281\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2015, rental obligations under long-term non-cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements for the next five years and thereafter are payable as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,218\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,160\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,697\\n\\n$\\n\\n318\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n12,393\\n\\nIn addition to its lease obligations, the Company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil in connection with its marketing activities.  Such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales, which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations.  Approximate commodity purchase obligations as of December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):\\n\\nJanuary\\n\\nRemaining\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\nThereafter\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,830\\n\\n$\\n\\n130\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n-\\n\\n$\\n\\n68,960\\n\\nInsurance\\n\\nFrom time to time, the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases. In the past, during such cyclical periods, the Company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable.  The Company's primary insurance needs are workers' compensation, automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for its employees.  Insurance costs are as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2013\\n\\nInsurance costs\\n\\n$\\n\\n15,570\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,800\\n\\n$\\n\\n14,900\\n\\nInsurance rates may experience increases during 2016 subject to market conditions and claims experience.  Because the Company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases, any increase must be absorbed by existing operations.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nIn all phases of its operations, the Company encounters strong competition from a number of entities. Many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the Company. The Company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit, pricing of available materials and quality of service, as well as for the acquisition of mineral properties. The Company's marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities.  These major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the Company.  From time to time in recent years, there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace.  This in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas. As a result, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization.\\n\\n26\\n\\nOutlook\\n\\nPersistently low crude oil prices, coupled with declining oil production, are expected to adversely impact the Company's crude oil marketing operation.  The goal is to maintain at least 85 percent of 2015 supply volumes, but such effort may come at the expense of reduced unit margins.    Demand for transportation services remains uncertain.  The focus in transportation, therefore, is on both aggressive marketing and cost containment.  For the oil and gas segment, the effort is to reduce cost and optimize cash flow as reserves are produced.  In January 2016, the Company invested in an employer-oriented medical management services firm and development of this investment area continues.\\n\\nThe Company has the following major objectives for 2016:\\n\\n-\\n\\nMarketing—manage declining supply volumes and unit margins to maintain operating earnings at the $15 million level, exclusive of inventory valuation changes.\\n\\n-\\n\\nTransportation—increase truck utilization and improve cost efficiencies to maintain operating earnings at the $3 million level.\\n\\n-\\n\\nOil and gas—curtail all exploration activity; maintain oil and gas production; reduce operating overhead.\\n\\n-\\n\\nEmployer-oriented medical management services—develop earnings enhancement opportunities arising from employer and employee insurance coverage.\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\\n\\nFair Value Accounting\\n\\nThe Company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value.  Changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for, and the Company elects, cash flow hedge accounting.  The Company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during 2015, 2014 and 2013.\\n\\nThe Company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts.  On a contract by contract, forward month by forward month basis, the Company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts that typically have durations of less than 18 months.  As of December 31, 2015, all of the Company's market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs) or from inputs based on observable market data (Level 2 inputs). See discussion under ‟Fair Value Measurements\" in Note (1) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nThe Company's fair value contracts give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment.  The Company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the Company's risk management policies.  Such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management's objectives, strategies and current market conditions.\\n\\nTrade Accounts\\n\\nAccounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the Company.  Particularly within the Company's energy marketing, oil and gas exploration, and production operations, there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties (including transaction counterparties) to provide adequate information for the proper recording of accounts receivable or payable. Substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the Company with the source documents for recording trade activity.  It is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents. This typically requires the Company to absorb, benefit from, or pass along such corrections to another third party.\\n\\n27\\n\\nDue to the volume and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties, this is a difficult area to control and manage.  The Company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties.  Ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the Company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances.  The Company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims.  In addition, the Company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance.  Nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry.\\n\\nOil and Gas Reserve Estimate\\n\\nThe value of the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  Reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors.  The accuracy of these estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data, production performance data, reservoir engineering data, the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data.  The process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision (usually on an annual basis) as additional information becomes available. Calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production, and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates. Also, certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing.  The Company's calculations assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer's estimates, except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts.  There can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions, governmental regulation, political conditions, economic conditions, weather conditions, market uncertainty, and other factors, impact the market price for oil and natural gas.\\n\\nThe Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting, so only costs (including development dry hole costs) associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized.  Estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the Company's units of production method for depreciating, depleting and amortizing oil and natural gas properties. Estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the Company's periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment.\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\nAREC is named as a defendant in a number of Louisiana based lawsuits involving alleged environmental contamination from prior drilling operations.  Such suits typically allege improper disposal of oilfield wastes in earthen pits with one suit alleging oil and gas production subsidence contributing to the formation of a sink hole.  AREC is currently named as a defendant in three such suits.    While management does not believe that a material adverse effect will result from the claims, significant attorney fees will be incurred to defend these items.  As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company has accrued $500,000 of future legal and/or settlement costs for these matters.\\n\\nFrom time to time as incident to its operations, the Company becomes involved in various accidents, lawsuits and/or disputes.  Primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet, the Company is a party to motor vehicle accidents, worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry.  In addition, the Company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws, environmental laws and labor laws, among others.  Should an incident occur, management evaluates the claim based on its nature, the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage.  To the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the Company, management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines.\\n\\n28\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n\\nThe Company's crude oil marketing customers are invoiced monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms.  Revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer.  Where required, the Company also recognizes fair value or mark-to-market gains and losses related to its commodity activities. See discussion under ‟Revenue Recognition\" in Note (1) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nTransportation segment customers are invoiced, and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided.  Oil and natural gas revenue from the Company's interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition.  The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  Management is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the transition alternatives.\\n\\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued guidance requiring management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued.  The standard also provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements.  The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nIn July 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for inventory to provide for the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost or ‟ net realizable value,\" as defined in the standard.  The new guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in the statement of financial position.  The amendment requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in the balance sheet.  The Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis effective December 31, 2015.\\n\\nManagement believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates, which are not yet effective, will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon adoption.   \n",
